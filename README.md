## ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

This project demonstrates how to use **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various health parameters. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we build a model that mimics the human brain to analyze and learn patterns from health-related data.

### 🧠 About the Project

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are the most fundamental type of deep learning models, consisting of multiple interconnected layers of neurons. In this project, we use ANN to classify whether an individual is at risk of heart disease based on key medical attributes.

The model consists of:

* **Input Layer** – Receives health-related features like age, cholesterol, etc.
* **Hidden Layers** – Learns non-linear relationships between features.
* **Output Layer** – Outputs a binary prediction (1 = has heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).

### 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset contains 13 input features representing individual medical conditions and risk factors, including:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol level
* Fasting blood sugar
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* ... and more

It also includes a **target** column:

* `1` indicates the presence of heart disease
* `0` indicates absence

📌 **Target Variable**: Presence of heart disease (binary classification)
